🌳 DSA Java – Trie (Prefix Tree) Practice

💻 Language Used
Java.

This repository contains my implementation of Trie (Prefix Tree) based problems in Java as part of my Data Structures & Algorithms practice.

Trie is a powerful data structure used for efficient string searching and prefix-based operations.

🚀 Topics Covered:-
✅ Trie Insertion.
✅ Count Unique Substrings.
✅ Longest Word with All Prefixes.
✅ Prefix Problem.
✅ Starts With Prefix.
✅ Word Break Problem.

📂 Implemented Files:-
Problem	Description
Insertion.java	Basic Trie insertion implementation
CountUniqueSubstring.java	Counts number of unique substrings using Trie
LongestWord.java	Finds longest word with all prefixes present
PrefixProblem.java	Prefix-based searching logic
StartWithPrefix.java	Checks if word starts with given prefix
WordBreakProblem.java	Word break using Trie

🧠 Concepts Used
Trie Node Structure
Character Mapping
Prefix Matching
Recursive Traversal
Backtracking
String Manipulation

🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my DSA preparation journey.
Practicing Trie problems to strengthen:
String data structure understanding
Efficient searching techniques
Interview preparation
